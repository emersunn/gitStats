# Git Stats

Git Stats is a Bash script that generates a summary of your Git repository's statistics, including commit count, contributors, and file changes. This script is designed to help developers quickly analyze the progress and contributions made in a Git project.

## Features

- Generate a summary of Git repository statistics
- Display commit count
- List contributors with the number of commits
- Show file changes (insertions, deletions, and total files changed)
- Save the statistics to a text file

## Prerequisites

- macOS or Linux
- Git

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `git_stats.sh` script.
2. Give the script execute permissions with the following command:

```chmod +x git_stats.sh```


3. Run the script in the terminal with:

```./git_stats.sh /path/to/your/repo```


The script will generate a summary of the Git repository's statistics and display it in the terminal. The statistics will also be saved to a text file named `git_stats.txt`.
